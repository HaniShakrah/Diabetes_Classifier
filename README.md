## Data
Data sourced from years 2018-2022 of CDC's annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey ([BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm)) 


## Survey Limitations

Survey is conducted only in the United States and surrounding islands. There may be underlying phenomena that may have to do with specific geographic or cultural conditions that affect the results. Caution should be taken before generalizing to other countries and continents. 

The only method of contact interviewers use is a phone call (landlines and cell phones) with Random Digit Dialing (RDD) techniques. Certain demographics may be hard to contact and introduce bias into the results. 

Recall bias – difficulty remembering, inaccuracy in responses due to forgetting of details

Selection bias – only English and Spanish speakers
